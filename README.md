#

This mod gives the mace a complete overhaul, making it as special as the trident, if not even more so!  
This mod also expands the capabilities of the mace by adding a new crafting recipe, new items, and a new ability, wind bounce!

You can wind bounce by using the mace on the ground below you, though it does cost a good amount of durabilty, use it wisely!
