This mod gives the mace a complete overhaul, making it as special as the trident, featuring a 3D model when equiped, with a nice 2D icon in the inventory.

This mod also expands the capabilities of the mace by adding a new enchantment known as "Wind Bounce", just hit the floor and kiss the ground goodbye! Be cautious however, Wind Bouncing can take a toll on your mace when used, so make sure to use your mace wisely!

> Wind Bounce II does less damage to your mace, and does even less damage when paired with Unbreaking, with Lv I halfing the damage your mace takes.
